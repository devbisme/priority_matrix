This is a matrix for prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency. 

The matrix is editable using Inkscape. Just duplicate one of the task templates, edit the task description, and position it within the matrix according to your perception of the urgency and importance of the task.

There are currently three matrix layers:

1. A locked frame layer that contains the matrix boundaries.
2. An unlocked layer for work-related tasks.
3. An unlocked layer for personal tasks.

By turning the layers on & off, you can prioritize your work & personal tasks.
